Looping the Loop
A loop is a structure that tells a computer to execute a set of statements multiple times. If you have a process that you want repeated hundreds of times, it pays to put it in a loop so you don't need to write hundreds of lines of code.

If you are working on these courses in order, you have already seen how a for loop can allow for a set number of loop iterations. But what about a situation where (due to randomness, perhaps) you don't know how many times the loop should repeat? In that case, you can use a while loop.

A while loop will execute as long as a certain condition is true. For example, the loop in the editor will simulate coin flips as long as the number of consecutive heads is less than 3.
