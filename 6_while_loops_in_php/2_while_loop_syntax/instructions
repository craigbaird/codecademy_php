While Loop Syntax
In the last exercise, you saw how a while loop can be used to repeat a set of commands an unknown number of times. That loop used the following syntax:

while(cond) {
   // looped statements go here
}
where the statements in side the curly braces { and } are executed as long as the condition cond is evaluated as true. In the last exercise, cond was the condition that the number of consecutive heads was less than 3: $headCount < 3.

It is important when writing loops to make sure that the loop will exit at some point. The loop

while(2 > 1){
   // Code
}
will never exit and is an example of an infinite loop. Avoid infinite loops like the plague! This is why we need to include $loopCond = false; in line 12. If you submit an infinite loop in one of these exercises, you will need to reload the page to stop it.

Instructions
Check out the while loop on line 9.

On line 9, add a condition inside the parentheses ( ) that makes the while loop run as long as $loopCond == true
Inside the curly braces, use echo to output "<p>The loop is running.</p>"
Then click Save & Submit Code to run your first PHP while loop!
